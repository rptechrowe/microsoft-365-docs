## How does Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 use your proprietary organizational data?

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 provides value by connecting LLMs to your organizational data. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 accesses content and context through Microsoft Graph. It can generate responses anchored in your organizational data, such as user documents, emails, calendar, chats, meetings, and contacts. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 combines this content with the user’s working context, such as the meeting a user is in now, the email exchanges the user had on a topic, or the chat conversations the user had last week. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 uses this combination of content and context to help provide accurate, relevant, and contextual responses.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prompts, responses, and data accessed through Microsoft Graph aren't used to train foundation LLMs, including those used by Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365.

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 only surfaces organizational data to which individual users have at least view permissions. It's important that you're using the permission models available in Microsoft 365 services, such as SharePoint, to help ensure the right users or groups have the right access to the right content within your organization. This includes permissions you give to users outside your organization through inter-tenant collaboration solutions, such as [shared channels in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/shared-channels).  

When you enter prompts using Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, the information contained within your prompts, the data they retrieve, and the generated responses remain within the Microsoft 365 service boundary, in keeping with our current privacy, security, and compliance commitments. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 uses Azure OpenAI services for processing, not OpenAI’s publicly available services.

> [!NOTE]
> When using Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, your organization’s data might leave the Microsoft 365 service boundary under the following circumstances:
>
> - When you allow Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 chat experiences to reference public web content. The query sent to Bing might include your organization’s data. For more information, see [Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and public web content](#microsoft-copilot-for-microsoft-365-and-public-web-content).
> - When you’re using plugins to help Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 to provide more relevant information. Check the privacy statement and terms of use of the plugin to determine how it will handle your organization’s data. For information, see [Extensibility of Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365](#extensibility-of-microsoft-copilot-for-microsoft-365).

Abuse monitoring for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 occurs in real-time, without providing Microsoft any standing access to customer data, either for human or for automated review. While abuse moderation, which includes human review of content, is available in Azure OpenAI, Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 services have opted out of it. Microsoft 365 data isn’t collected or stored by Azure OpenAI.

> [!NOTE]
> We may use customer feedback, which is optional, to improve Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, just like we use customer feedback to improve other Microsoft 365 services and Microsoft 365 apps. We don't use this feedback to train the foundation LLMs used by Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. Customers can manage feedback through admin controls. For more information, see [Manage Microsoft feedback for your organization](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-feedback-ms-org) and [Providing feedback about Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/c481c26a-e01a-4be3-bdd0-aee0b0b2a423).

### Data stored about user interactions with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365

When a user interacts with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 apps (such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OneNote, Loop, or Whiteboard), we store data about these interactions. The stored data includes the user's prompt, how Copilot responded, and information used to ground Copilot's response. For example, this stored data provides users with chat history in [Microsoft 365 Chat](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/5b00a52d-7296-48ee-b938-b95b7209f737) and [meetings in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/0bf9dd3c-96f7-44e2-8bb8-790bedf066b1). This data is stored in alignment with contractual commitments with your organization’s other content in Microsoft 365. The data is encrypted while it's stored and isn't used to train foundation LLMs, including those used by Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365.

To view and manage this stored data, admins can use Content search or Microsoft Purview. Admins can also use Microsoft Purview to set retention policies for the data related to chat interactions with Copilot. For more information, see the following articles:

- [Overview of Content search](/purview/ediscovery-content-search-overview)
- [Protect and manage Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 by using Microsoft Purview](/purview/ai-microsoft-purview)
- [Learn about retention for Copilot for Microsoft 365](/purview/retention-policies-copilot)

For Microsoft Teams chats with Copilot, admins can also use [Microsoft Teams Export APIs](/microsoftteams/export-teams-content) to view the stored data.

### Deleting the history of user interactions with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365

To delete a user's history of interactions with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, which includes user prompts and the responses Copilot returns, Microsoft 365 admins can [submit an online support ticket](/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-support#online-support) in the Microsoft 365 admin center. In this ticket, admins should include their [Tenant ID](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-find-tenant) and the user’s principal name (their [primary email address](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/change-a-user-name-and-email-address#set-the-primary-email-address)) for which they want data deleted. The ticket will mark the history for permanent, [hard-deletion](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-dsr-Office365#deleting-personal-data). For any new requests, open a new ticket with support and avoid editing your existing requests.  

### Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and public web content

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 chat experiences can reference public web content when responding to a user’s prompt. Based on the user’s prompt, Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 determines whether it needs to use Bing to query public web content to help provide a relevant response to the user.

If Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 determines web content can help provide a more relevant response, it generates a search query to send to Bing. That search query is based on the user’s prompt, conversation history, and data the user has access to in Microsoft 365. This query might include your organization’s data, but the user’s account and their tenant ID aren't included in the search query sent to Bing.

Microsoft Bing is a separate business from Microsoft 365 and data is managed independently of Microsoft 365. The use of Bing is covered by the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) between each user and Microsoft, together with the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). The [Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum (DPA)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA) doesn’t apply to the use of Bing.

Admins can prevent their users from referencing public web content in their requests. For more information, see [Manage access to public web content in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 responses](/microsoft-365-copilot/manage-public-web-access). Even when allowed by the admin, users still have the option whether or not they want to reference public web content in their requests.

> [!NOTE]
> The policy settings that control the use of optional connected experiences in Microsoft 365 Apps don’t apply to Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and public web content.

### Extensibility of Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365

While Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is already able to use the apps and data within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, many organizations still depend on various external tools and services for work management and collaboration. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 experiences can reference third-party tools and services when responding to a user’s request by using [Microsoft Graph connectors](/graph/connecting-external-content-connectors-overview) or plugins. Data from Graph connectors can be returned in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 responses if the user has permission to access that information.

When plugins are enabled, Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 determines whether it needs to use a specific plugin to help provide a relevant response to the user. If a plugin is needed, Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 generates a search query to send to the plugin on the user’s behalf. The query is based on the user’s prompt, conversation history, and data the user has access to in Microsoft 365.

In the **Integrated apps** section of the [Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview), admins can view the permissions and data access required by a plugin as well as the plugin’s terms of use and privacy statement. Admins have full control to select which plugins are allowed in their organization. A user can only access the plugins that their admin allows and that the user installed or is assigned. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 only uses plugins that are turned on by the user.

> [!NOTE]
> The policy settings that control the use of optional connected experiences in Microsoft 365 Apps don’t apply to plugins.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Manage Plugins for Copilot in Integrated Apps](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps)
- [Extend Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/)
- [How Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 can work with your external data](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-mechanics-blog/how-microsoft-365-copilot-can-work-with-your-external-data/ba-p/3937645)

## Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the EU Data Boundary

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 calls to the LLM are routed to the closest data centers in the region, but also can call into other regions where capacity is available during high utilization periods.

For European Union (EU) users, we have additional safeguards to comply with the [EU Data Boundary](/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-learn). EU traffic stays within the EU Data Boundary while worldwide traffic can be sent to the EU and other countries or regions for LLM processing.

## Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and data residency

Customers with [Advanced Data Residency (ADR) in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/enterprise/advanced-data-residency) or [Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo) can purchase and enable Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. At this time, Microsoft doesn't provide data residency commitments for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, beyond EU Data Boundary. When customers store data generated by Copilot in Microsoft 365 products that have data residency commitments under the Product Terms, the applicable commitments will be upheld.

## How does Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 protect organizational data?

The permissions model within your Microsoft 365 tenant can help ensure that data won't unintentionally leak between users, groups, and tenants. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 presents only data that each individual can access using the same underlying controls for data access used in other Microsoft 365 services. Semantic Index honors the user identity-based access boundary so that the grounding process only accesses content that the current user is authorized to access. For more information, see Microsoft’s [privacy policy and service documentation](https://privacy.microsoft.com/).  

When you have data that's encrypted by Microsoft Purview Information Protection, Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 honors the usage rights granted to the user. This encryption can be applied by [sensitivity labels](/purview/sensitivity-labels) or by restricted permissions in Microsoft 365 apps by using Information Rights Management (IRM). For more information about using Microsoft Purview with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, see [Protect and manage Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 interactions with Microsoft Purview](/purview/ai-microsoft-purview).

We already implement multiple forms of protection to help prevent customers from compromising Microsoft 365 services and applications or gaining unauthorized access to other tenants or the Microsoft 365 system itself. Here are some examples of those forms of protection:

- Logical isolation of customer content within each tenant for Microsoft 365 services is achieved through Microsoft Entra authorization and role-based access control. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 isolation controls](/compliance/assurance/assurance-microsoft-365-isolation-controls).

- Microsoft uses rigorous physical security, background screening, and a multi-layered encryption strategy to protect the confidentiality and integrity of customer content.

- Microsoft 365 uses service-side technologies that encrypt customer content at rest and in transit, including BitLocker, per-file encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). For specific details about encryption in Microsoft 365, see [Encryption in the Microsoft Cloud](/microsoft-365/compliance/office-365-encryption-in-the-microsoft-cloud-overview).

- Your control over your data is reinforced by Microsoft's commitment to comply with broadly applicable privacy laws, such as the GDPR, and privacy standards, such as ISO/IEC 27018, the world’s first international code of practice for cloud privacy.

- For content accessed through Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 plug-ins, encryption can exclude programmatic access, thus limiting the plug-in from accessing the content. For more information, see [Configure usage rights for Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/configure-usage-rights).

## Meeting regulatory compliance requirements

As regulation in the AI space evolves, Microsoft will continue to adapt and respond to fulfill future regulatory requirements.

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is built on top of Microsoft’s current commitments to data security and privacy in the enterprise. There's no change to these commitments. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is integrated into Microsoft 365 and adheres to all existing privacy, security, and compliance commitments to Microsoft 365 commercial customers. For more information, see [Microsoft Compliance](/compliance).

Beyond adhering to regulations, we prioritize an open dialogue with our customers, partners, and regulatory authorities to better understand and address concerns, thereby fostering an environment of trust and cooperation. We acknowledge that privacy, security, and transparency aren't just features, but prerequisites in the AI-driven landscape at Microsoft.

### About the content that Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 creates

The responses that generative AI produces aren't guaranteed to be 100% factual. While we continue to improve responses, users should still use their judgment when reviewing the output before sending them to others. Our Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 capabilities provide useful drafts and summaries to help you achieve more while giving you a chance to review the generated AI rather than fully automating these tasks.

We continue to improve algorithms to proactively address issues, such as misinformation and disinformation, content blocking, data safety, and preventing the promotion of harmful or discriminatory content in line with our [responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/our-approach).

Microsoft doesn't claim ownership of the output of the service. That said, we don't make a determination on whether a customer’s output is copyright protected or enforceable against other users. This is because generative AI systems may produce similar responses to similar prompts or queries from multiple customers. Consequently, multiple customers may have or claim rights in content that is the same or substantially similar.

If a third party sues a commercial customer for copyright infringement for using Microsoft’s Copilots or the output they generate, we'll defend the customer and pay the amount of any adverse judgments or settlements that result from the lawsuit, as long as the customer used the guardrails and content filters we have built into our products. For more information, see [Microsoft announces new Copilot Copyright Commitment for customers](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/).

### Committed to responsible AI

As AI is poised to transform our lives, we must collectively define new rules, norms, and practices for the use and impact of this technology. Microsoft has been on a Responsible AI journey since 2017, when we defined our principles and approach to ensuring this technology is used in a way that is driven by ethical principles that put people first.

At Microsoft, we're guided by our [AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/our-approach), our [Responsible AI Standard](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE5cmFl), and decades of research on AI, grounding, and privacy-preserving machine learning. A multidisciplinary team of researchers, engineers and policy experts reviews our AI systems for potential harms and mitigations — refining training data, filtering to limit harmful content, query- and result-blocking sensitive topics, and applying Microsoft technologies like [InterpretML](https://www.microsoft.com/research/uploads/prod/2020/05/InterpretML-Whitepaper.pdf) and [Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) to help detect and correct data bias. We make it clear how the system makes decisions by noting limitations, linking to sources, and prompting users to review, fact-check, and adjust content based on subject-matter expertise. For more information, see [Governing AI: A Blueprint for the Future](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW14Gtw).

We aim to help our customers use our AI products responsibly, sharing our learnings, and building trust-based partnerships. For these new services, we want to provide our customers with information about the intended uses, capabilities, and limitations of our AI platform service, so they have the knowledge necessary to make responsible deployment choices. We also share resources and templates with developers inside organizations and with independent software vendors (ISVs), to help them build effective, safe, and transparent AI solutions.
